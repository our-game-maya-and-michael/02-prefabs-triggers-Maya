# Unity week 2: Formal elements

In this project I added borders to the game. Going right or left will make us jump to the opposite side of the screen. This was done by adding a wall that triggers the jump. In addition, there is no option of exiting the screen at the top and botton do to a static wall that is blocking the spaceship from moving.
I also created a a health system. At the begining of the game the player has 3 lives and can collect more lives by hitting the random hearts that show up on the screen.
